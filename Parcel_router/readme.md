PostNL Postal Code Validator: Your First QA ProjectThis project is a simplified model of a real-world scenario you might encounter at Prime Vision, specifically within the Smart Integration Management platform, working for a client like PostNL. It demonstrates the core concepts of software development and quality assurance (QA) in a practical way.The Problem This Project SolvesImagine PostNL receives millions of parcels daily. Each parcel has a destination postal code. Before a parcel can be routed, the system needs to quickly check if its postal code is valid and falls within a "standard" delivery area. If not, it might need "special handling" (e.g., manual review, different routing, or a return to sender). This project simulates that decision-making process.Project ComponentsYou'll be working with two main Python files, reflecting the collaboration between developers and QA:postal*validator.py (The Developer's Code):This file contains the core logic that a developer on your team would write. It's the "brain" that decides how to categorize a postal code.It also includes some "mock parcel data" and a simple way to "run" the system to see its immediate output.test_postal_validator.py (Your QA Automation Code):This file is where you, as the QA Engineer, will write automated tests. You'll use a popular Python testing framework called pytest to ensure the developer's logic works correctly under various scenarios.Understanding the Codepostal_validator.py (The "System" Logic)STANDARD_POSTAL_CODE_PREFIXES: This is a Python list that acts like a very tiny, in-memory "database" of known standard postal code prefixes (the first two digits of a Dutch postal code). In a real PostNL system, this would be a massive, constantly updated database.validate_dutch_postal_code(postal_code: str) -> str: This is the core function.It takes a postal_code as input.It first performs a very basic check for valid format (is it a string? Is it long enough?).Then, it checks if the first two digits of the postal code are in our STANDARD_POSTAL_CODE_PREFIXES list.Based on these checks, it returns either "Standard Delivery" or "Special Handling" with a reason.mock_parcels_for_validation: This is a list of Python dictionaries, each representing a "parcel" with an ID and a postal code. We use this to simulate incoming data.if **name** == "**main**": block: This section of code runs only when you execute postal_validator.py directly. It iterates through the mock_parcels and calls the validate_dutch_postal_code function for each, printing the result. This simulates the system "running" and processing parcels.test_postal_validator.py (Your QA Automation)import pytest: This line brings in the pytest testing framework.from postal_validator import validate_dutch_postal_code, STANDARD_POSTAL_CODE_PREFIXES: This line is crucial! It imports the actual function you want to test (validate_dutch_postal_code) from the developer's file. This is how your tests connect to the code they are verifying.def test_something(): functions: Each function starting with test* is a separate automated test case.Happy Path Tests: (test*standard_postal_code_valid, test_another_standard_postal_code_valid) These verify that the function works correctly for expected, valid inputs.Negative Path Tests: (test_non_standard_postal_code_numeric_prefix, test_invalid_short_postal_code_format, test_empty_postal_code, test_none_postal_code) These verify how the system handles incorrect or unexpected inputs, ensuring it doesn't crash and provides appropriate error messages or categorizations.Edge Cases: (test_long_postal_code_format) These test boundary conditions or unusual but potentially valid inputs.assert keyword: This is the core of pytest's assertions. Instead of many self.assert... methods like in unittest, pytest lets you use Python's native assert statement. If the condition after assert is False, the test fails, and pytest provides a detailed error message, making it easy to understand what went wrong.Step-by-Step Execution Guide (for MacBook VS Code)Follow these steps to set up and run your first QA project:1. Create Your Project FolderOpen VS Code: Launch Visual Studio Code on your MacBook.Create a New Folder:Go to File > Open Folder... (or use the shortcut ⌘ + K, ⌘ + O).Navigate to a location where you want to save your project (e.g., your "Documents" folder, or a "Projects" folder you create).Click the "New Folder" button (it looks like a folder icon with a plus sign).Type postnl_validator_project as the folder name and press Enter.Click "Open" to open this newly created, empty folder in VS Code.2. Create the Developer's Code File (postal_validator.py)Create a New File: In the VS Code Explorer (the left sidebar), hover over your postnl_validator_project folder. You'll see an icon for "New File" (a paper icon with a plus sign). Click it.Name the File: Type postal_validator.py and press Enter.Paste the Code: Copy the entire Python code block from the "Developer's Code" section above (the one titled postal_validator.py) and paste it into this new file.Save: Press ⌘ + S to save the file.3. Install pytestOpen VS Code Terminal: Go to the top menu bar, click Terminal > New Terminal (or use the shortcut `Ctrl + `` (that's the backtick key, usually above Tab)).Install Pytest: In the terminal that appears at the bottom of VS Code, type the following command and press Enter:pip install pytest
Troubleshooting pip: If you get an error like "command not found: pip", try python3 -m pip install pytest. This ensures you're using the pip associated with your Python 3 installation.4. Create Your QA Automation File (test_postal_validator.py)Create a New File: Back in the VS Code Explorer, click the "New File" icon again (next to your postnl_validator_project folder).Name the File: Type test_postal_validator.py and press Enter. (Remember, pytest looks for files starting with test*.)Paste the Code: Copy the entire Python code block from the "QA Automation Code" section above (the one titled test_postal_validator.py) and paste it into this new file.Save: Press ⌘ + S to save the file.5. Run the Developer's Code (See the "System" in Action)This step shows you how the core logic works with some example data, mimicking a live system.Open postal_validator.py: In the VS Code Explorer, click on postal_validator.py to open it in the editor.Run: Right-click anywhere in the code editor area. From the context menu that appears, select "Run Python File in Terminal."Observe: Look at the VS Code terminal. You will see output like:--- PostNL Postal Code Validator Simulation ---
...
Parcel ID: P001, Postal Code: '1012 AB' -> Result: Standard Delivery
...

---

This shows you the immediate results of the validate*dutch_postal_code function for each mock parcel.6. Run Your Automated QA TestsThis step executes your automated checks to verify the correctness of the developer's code.Open Terminal: If you closed it, open a new terminal (Terminal > New Terminal).Run Pytest: In the terminal, make sure you are in your postnl_validator_project folder. You should see postnl_validator_project in the terminal prompt (e.g., yourname@yourmacbook postnl_validator_project %).Type the following command and press Enter:pytest -v
The -v flag stands for "verbose," which means pytest will give you more detailed output, showing each test as it runs.Observe:pytest will automatically discover and run all the test* functions in your test_postal_validator.py file.You'll see output for each test, indicating if it PASSED (good!) or FAILED (bug found!).At the end, pytest will provide a summary, for example:============================= test session starts ==============================
...
test_postal_validator.py::test_standard_postal_code_valid PASSED
test_postal_validator.py::test_another_standard_postal_code_valid PASSED
test_postal_validator.py::test_non_standard_postal_code_numeric_prefix PASSED
test_postal_validator.py::test_invalid_short_postal_code_format PASSED
test_postal_validator.py::test_empty_postal_code PASSED
test_postal_validator.py::test_none_postal_code PASSED
test_postal_validator.py::test_long_postal_code_format PASSED
============================== 7 passed in X.XXs ===============================
If all tests pass, you'll see PASSED for each and a final "passed" summary. If any fail, you'll see FAILED and detailed traceback information.You've now successfully set up a basic Python project, run developer code, and executed automated QA tests using pytest! This simple example gives you a foundational understanding of the development and testing cycle you'll be part of at Prime Vision.
